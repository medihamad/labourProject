            <h2>The Gender Component</h2>
            <p>
                TLAU gives priority to issues of gender equality and women's empowerment. We encourage participation of women, men, boys and girls in programmes and projects for sustainable development. According to Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) of 2012/13, 41% of women are employed as compared to 55% of men. Out of 41% only 13.8% are in formal employment. Uganda's Economy is mainly agricultural based. Over 80% of the agricultural sector is performed by women. However men who are 50% of the population are the main beneficiaries of the womenâ€™s sweat. It is a fact that less than 20% of all titled land in Uganda is owned by women yet they are the main users of land in Uganda. TLAU gender specialists work with various stakeholders to enforce gender equality and mainstreaming,Protection of the rights of women,eradication of child labour, and protection of the rights of other vulnerable groups.
